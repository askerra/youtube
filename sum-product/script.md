## Introduction

Everyone wants to go fast.

So they move fast.

They scramble and

I'm like, do you get?

And they're like, yeah.

And I'm like, do you really get it?

And they're like, I really do.

So show me.

## Theory

### Sum

#### No $b$ value

The easiest place to start is with a quadratic with no b-term.

So something like $x^2=16$

We take the square root and get one negative and one positive solution.

Plus four minus four equals zero so the sum here is just zero.

But what about if we add an "a" value?

Here all that changes is we divide by a constant first, then it's all the same.

The solutions cancel out and we're left with zero again.

So now let's generalize.

As long as $c$ and $a$ are both positive here, we're going to get one positive real root and one negative real root that cancel out again to give zero.

Same applies if we move $c$ over to the other side. This time $a$ and $c$ have to have different signs, or we'll wind up with no real solutions, but otherwise we get the same result. The sum is simply zero.

#### Vertex Form

In the vertex form something similar happens. We get the same cancelling out of the plus-minus part, but in this case we're left with two ones, which equals two.

Same thing happens here when we add an $a$ value. The plus-minus part cancels out and we're left with two thirteens, which gives us 26.

This makes sense because whatever we have under the root will always cancel itself out, leaving two $h$'s, which gives us $2h$

#### The general form

For the general form we can start with a quadratic that factors nicely like $x^2 +8x +15$.

Adding our two solutions gives us $-8$, which looks familiar, albeit with the sign flipped.

Testing out another easy-to-factor example produces the same result. In this case the sum of solutions is 7 which is the negative of the minus 7 from our initial quadratic.

To generalize, we work backwards from the factored form, expand, and combine like terms to find that our solutions should actually equal $-\frac{b}{a}$.

This isn't the most intuitive way, but it will be helpful in a few minutes.

A more intuitive approach is to use the quadratic formula.

Here things should look familiar.

Our two solutions are formed from the plus-minus root, and when we add these up, all the nasty parts disappear, leaving us with two $-\frac{b}{2a}$'s, which is really just $-\frac{b}{a}$ in disguise.
